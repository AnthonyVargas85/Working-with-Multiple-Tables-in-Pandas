# Working-with-Multiple-Tables-in-Pandas
Creating a DataFrame made by matching the common columns of two DataFrames is called a merge We can specify which columns should be matches by using the keyword arguments left_on and right_on We can combine DataFrames whose rows don't all match using left, right, and outer merges and the how keyword argument We can stack or concatenate DataFrames with the same columns using pd.concat
